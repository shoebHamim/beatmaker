// how did the pad selection work

1. we created an object constructor called drumkit 
2. in that object we selected all the pads(queryselectorAll) 
and saved it as the object's property
3. then we looped through all the pads and added event listener
to them that when clicked it invoked another method called 
drumkit.activepad
4. in that method, this keyword refers to the pad we are adding event
listener to and it adds a active class in that pad
5. we created css class for that specific pads with specific background color
that's how it works
